# api_bored
  This is an example of a very simple app using an API. Namely we use pure javascript embedded directly in an HTML file, to get results from an API called <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/documentation">the "bored" API</a>.
  
<a href="https://simmoe.github.io/api_bored/">See the app in action here</a>
  
  The structure of the page is made up of a small jQuery menu - when you click menu items, the page toggles visibility on respective div sections. This is a neat and quick way to build a one-page html app, that is superquick and still easy to overview code wise.  
  
  The API calls are made with the jQuery ajax function. Ajax is short for "asynchronous javascript and xml". In fact the xml part doesn't really apply to many modern applications, since what we see in our response objects is instead JSON. To work with this pice of code, all you need to know is that the $.ajax() parts in the code, means we are requesting data from an external source - here, the bored api - and when we get something in return (.done()), we can use data in the app.

## Handlebars
  We also use a js framework called <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>, to ease json formatting. 
  
  
  Lastly - and really the reason we use handlebars - we use a rather complex css boilerplate, <a href="https://materializecss.com/cards.html"> called materialize</a>, which gives us some rather cool layouts. 
  
  Hence the total project presents a set of meaningful skills and architecture in frontend web-programming.
