# api_bored
This is an example of a very simple app using an API. Namely we use pure javascript embedded directly in an HTML file, to get results from an API called the "bored" API. We also use a js framework called handlebars, to ease json formatting. Lastly we use a rather complex css boilerplate, materialize, which gives us some rather cool layouts. Hence the project presents a set of meaningful skills and architecture in frontend web-programming.
